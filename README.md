Hey community! 👋 I recently developed a Text-to-Speech converter using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This fun and functional project allows you to input text and listen to it being spoken in various voices.

🌐 HTML: The structure of the project is built with HTML, providing a user-friendly interface.

🎨 CSS: Stylized with a vibrant gradient background, unique fonts, and a clean layout, making the user experience visually appealing.

🗣️ JavaScript: The core functionality is powered by JavaScript. It dynamically populates a voice selection dropdown, allowing you to choose from available voices. Clicking the "Listen" button triggers the conversion of the entered text into speech.

🎙️ Speech Synthesis API: Leveraging the Speech Synthesis API, the application interacts with the browser's built-in speech synthesis capabilities.
